                                Many food shortages arose during WW1, due to panic buying and hoarding.
                                Hunger arose throughout Britain and food distribution suffered since soldiers fighting
                                in the war also needed supplies of food, but it wasn’t until early 1915 when the Germans
                                had launched an unrestricted submarine warfare campaign in which they sank merchant ships
                                that would be carrying food supplies and henceforth led to many food shortages. The
                                recently passed DORA (Defence of Realm Act) enforced a new rationing rule which made
                                food supplies guaranteed so the public would be kept from starvation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Governments responded to the shortages with prices being raised on staple foodstuffs to
                                control the amount of consumption but then the essential food imports such as sugar,
                                potatoes, meat, and wheat were starting to often be in short-supply and were therefore
                                amongst the first to be rationed, starting with sugar.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ration cards were issued in July 1918 to assist the rationing process and everyone
                                had to register it with their local butcher and grocer and fines were also introduced
                                for people found feeding stray animals or pigeons as the food was in need of preservation,
                                to reduce waste. Despite the initial problems that people would have faced with this new concept,
                                rationing did eventually begin to pay off and nobody in Britain was malnourished because of the war.

                            <p>
                                The Battle of the Somme will be the longest and most memorable battle in World War One History.
                                Spanning 141 days, it was a combined operation between the forces on the sides of the British
                                and the French to conquer the Western front, the main theatre of war at the time opened up by
                                the German army after invading Belgium and Luxembourg soon after the start of the war in August 1914.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The prior year, the Allied commanders had discussed and agreed to launch a joint attack along
                                the 25-mile front in the region of the River Somme in northern France but the increased pressure
                                made on the French from the Germans in Verdun throughout 1916 diverted many French divisions that
                                were meant to be used at the Somme, increased the urge for the attack to commence and also meant
                                that the “supporting” attack from the British would take the main role in the offensive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A 7-day long heavy artillery bombardment preceded the attack, using around 2 million shells, which
                                was intended to cut the barbed wire guarding the German defences and mess up their positions and
                                would create a barrage when the attack begun behind which the infantry could attack, assuming the
                                German defences were weakened. The Allied leaders had been confident that the German defences
                                would be so shattered that their troops could easily rush over and occupy their trenches, but they
                                overestimated their own firepower. The barbed wire remained intact in many places and the German
                                positions, mostly deep underground, were stronger than anticipated and the shells fired were
                                consequently ineffective.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At 7:30 am on the first day of July that year, the British divisions attacked but they were not
                                able to keep up with the barrage that was supposed to lead them to the German trenches as their
                                prior artillery bombardment was rendered ineffective. This gave the Germans enough time to get
                                out of their dugouts and man the trenches, resulting in the British infantry, led by General Sir
                                Douglas Haig, being met by rifle, machine-gun, and artillery fire. The British forces suffered
                                over 57,000 casualties that day, making it the bloodiest day in the nation’s military history.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Other French and British forces had more success to the south, but the winnings were quite delimited
                                compared to the catastrophic losses endured on the first day of the battle. General Haig was, however,
                                determined to continue with the offensive although it was the only option since the French were still
                                under pressure at Verdun. On 14 July, a dawn attack, led by the British 4th army and supported by a
                                fierce, was carried out at Longueval ridge and it had taken the Germans by surprise and they had
                                captured the ridge by mid-morning they had captured the ridge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With German morale falling due to lost ground near the end of August, the Germans had a change in
                                command which would mark a change in their strategy; they were going to build a defensive line behind
                                the Somme front which would concede their own territory but give them the opportunity to inflict more
                                casualties upon the advancing Allied troops.

                                During an attack on Flers-Courcelette on September 15, the British artillery barrage was escorted by an
                                advance of 12 divisions of soldiers chaperoned by 49 Mark 1 tanks, making their first ever appearance in
                                British history. Unfortunately, the tanks were quite slow and although the British made an advance of 1.5
                                miles, they underwent 29,000 casualties and failed to make a breakthrough. Bad weather hindered another
                                Allied attack as October began, with soldiers finding it difficult to cross over the muddy terrain under
                                intense fire from German fighter planes and artillery. The Allies made their final advance of the battle
                                in mid-November but with the deteriorating weather and the upcoming of Winter, General Haig at last called
                                off the offensive on November 18, marking the end of the battle of attrition displayed at the Somme. The
                                British had advanced only seven miles and failed to break the German line over 141 days. The British
                                Empire had suffered 420,000 casualties and 200,000 French in the process and there were at least 450,000
                                German casualties, which is shocking considering the losses on only the first day of the 141.

                                More than anything else, for most people the Battle of the Somme – especially its horrific first day – would
                                be remembered as the essence of the exemplification of military incompetence in the First World War. British
                                officers and for the most part General Haig would be criticised for continuing the offensive despite the
                                devastating losses though he had no other option. Moreover, the battle contributed towards a tough lesson
                                of how to fight a large-scale war and out sprung a more effective and professional army. Tactics such as
                                the use of creeping barrages and tanks developed, laying down the foundations for some of the Allies’ later
                                successes. The battle at the Somme also succeeded in taking the pressure of the French at Verdun. The British
                                abandoning them would have greatly tested the unity of the entente (alliance).

                                Many of the British soldiers who fought at the Somme were army service volunteers from ’14 and ’15 and the
                                battle was their first sight at combat. Many of which were part of the Pals battalions, or units consisting
                                of friends, neighbours, and relatives but the losses amongst the Pals battalions plummeted many British
                                communities into grief.

                                Despite its failure, the Allied offensive at the Somme imposed serious damage on the German positions in
                                France, causing them to strategically retreat to the Hindenburg Line in March 1917 and the move was also
                                a direct consequence of the loss of troops from the battle.

                                'Went over top…after an interminable period of terrible apprehension. Our artillery seemed to increase
                                in intensity and the German guns opened up on No Man’s Land. The din was deafening, the fumes choking
                                and visibility limited owing to the dust and clouds caused by exploding shells. It was a veritable
                                inferno. I was momentarily expecting to be blown to pieces. My platoon continued to advance in good order 
                                without many casualties and had reached half way to the Boche line. Suddenly... an appalling rifle and
                                machine gun fire opened against us and my men commenced to fall. I shouted “down” but most of those that
                                were still not hit had already taken cover. I dropped in a shell hole and occasionally attempted to move
                                to my right and left but bullets were forming an impenetrable barrage and exposure of the head meant
                                certain death. None of our men was visible but in all directions came pitiful groans and cries of pain'.
